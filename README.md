## _SqueezeSeg_: Convolutional Neural Nets with Recurrent CRF for Real-Time Road-Object Segmentation from 3D LiDAR Point Cloud

By Bichen Wu, Alvin Wan, Xiangyu Yue, Kurt Keutzer (UC Berkeley)

This repository contains a tensorflow implementation of SqueezeSeg, a convolutional neural network model for LiDAR segmentation. A demonstration of SqueezeSeg can be found below:

## Installation:

The instructions are tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.0 with GPU support. 
- Clone the SqueezeSeg repository:
    ```Shell
    git clone https://github.com/BichenWuUCB/SqueezeSeg.git
    ```
    We name the root directory as `$SQSG_ROOT`.

- Setup virtual environment.
    1. By default we use Python2.7. Create the virtual environment
        ```Shell
        virtualenv env
        ```

    2. Activate the virtual environment
        ```Shell
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

- Use pip to install required Python packages:
    ```Shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Demo:
- To run the demo script:
  ```Shell
  cd $SQSG_ROOT/
  python ./src/demo.py
  ```
  If the installation is correct, the detector should write the detection results as well as 2D label maps to `$SQSG_ROOT/data/samples_out`. Here is an example of the output label map:
